// Firebase is being directly used in the different screens
// Firebase is a low-level abstraction layer that is talking with firebase to provide with high-level functionalities
// The UI is directly communicating with backend
// Auth exceptions will be moved to a seperate file as these are being handled in the main UI
// The Firebase user should not be exposed to the UI. There should be no transparency
